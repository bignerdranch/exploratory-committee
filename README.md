# exploratory-committee

## Contribution Guidelines

This is the base repo to hold the front and back ends for the web application, as well as any iOS code required.

The front end will be Vue and Apollo, the backend will be Prisma/GraphQL/Node.

## What does our project aim to accomplish?
Our project allows Apple Watch users to view, interact with, and approve/deny designs and prototypes put together by a UX/UI Designer in a web-based application similar to InVision. The Designer can send their work to an Apple Watch to review designs, get design feedback from their team, and conduct A/B testing to decide the best approach for their project. 

## What void does this fill?
Currently, InVision does not allow a user to interact with a prototype on an Apple Watch at all. We want to allow a Designer to send prototypes to an Apple Watch user to allow them to interact with it - and we’re not just talking about prototypes native to an Apple Watch - we want to allow any platform’s design file to be interactive on the Apple Watch. 
The Apple Watch user will also be able to send telemetry back to the server based on what they like & dislike on the screen - this will allow the designer to perform A/B testing. 

## Which BNR client(s) does this align with the most?
Likely this would be any DPD project that utilizes a Designer.
For example, with specifics coming later:
CFA
Peloton
Franciscan Ministries
JustWorks
